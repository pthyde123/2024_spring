# There are two accessions from Juan that don't appear to be on t3 (LEGGETT and NEWBURG)
# Peter put them in this GRM and set them to 1
# Instead, change 1 to NA and calculate mean of diagonal

# still having troubles with the BGLR results reducing the number of oats
# could be that it is not full rank: at least one row or column that can be calculated as a linear combination of another row or column 
# on the assumption that there aren't still two rows or columns that are the same, could be that one is the average of two other ones

# double check that things are the right dimensions at each step
# verify the hypothesis that it isn't full rank
  #eigen() should be symmetric 
  #eigen values : look for zero or negative, these are bad
eigen(GRM2, only.values = TRUE)
  # this shows that the last eigen is much smaller than the others but is not negative or zero
tst <- cor(GRM2) # correlation 
diag(tst) <- 0 # want to find highly correlated accessions, but don't want the 1 self correlation diagonal, so setting to 0
mn <- which(abs(tst) == max(abs(tst)), arr.ind=T) # find highest correlation
#SABER and IL17-5238 have 0.9596241238 correlation, so very similar but probably not the same  

# trying the add the 0.1 thing
GRM3 <- GRM2
diag(GRM3) <- diag(GRM3) + 0.0001
# better to avoid doing this, but a really small number could be ok, could be as small as twice the smallest eigen value

data for ytraits

```{r obsdata, message=FALSE}

#pth: the na's for the mono pea accession were causing error

#this fixed the error, but is it correct

Create matrix for response and factors

```{r factors, message=FALSE}
yTraits <- as.matrix(dplyr::select(grainWgt, contains("Yield")))# pulls oat yield and pea yield ; taking factors with yield in them from grain weight table and making them a matrix # could have as many y variables in the matrix as you want, will run each on their own but no limit to what matrix holds
#factors into matrices
incLocations <- model.matrix(~ -1 + location, grainWgt) # 0,1 for if plots existed in given location or not; going into grain weight table, pulling out location data, and turns it into 0,1 somehow 
incBlocks <- model.matrix(~ -1 + blockNumberF, grainWgt)
incOatAcc <- model.matrix(~ -1 + germplasmName, grainWgt)
incPeaAcc <- model.matrix(~ -1 + peaAcc, grainWgt)
incYear <- model.matrix(~ -1 + studyYear, grainWgt) #year factor
incMngt <- model.matrix(~ -1 + management, grainWgt) # monoculture/intercrop factor
```

Create K matrix

```{r K, message=FALSE}
#  use K = Z %*% GRM %*% t(Z),  Z is incidence matrix
K = incOatAcc %*% GRM2 %*% t(incOatAcc)

# try with the matrix with 0.001 added to the diagonal 
K2 = incOatAcc %*% GRM3 %*% t(incOatAcc)
```

list of factor matrices

```{r ETA, message=FALSE}
ETA <- list(list(X=incLocations, model="FIXED"),
            list(X=incBlocks, model="BRR"),
            list(X=incPeaAcc, model="BRR"),

            list(X=incMngt, model="BRR"),
            list(K = K2, model="RKHS")) 

# the order of these is critical: nothing is labeled in matrices, so we need to know it's position to pull the right info out of results (through it's number rather than a name)

```

BGLR Model

```{r BGLR}
# this will take a few seconds to run, ?how doe we evaluate the best number of nIter and burnIn?
# will set.seed make this reproducible?
